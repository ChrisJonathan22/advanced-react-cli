# Advanced React CLI (under development)

This is an npm package which aims to provide a better way to install a React starter application and third-party packages for your application through an intuitive CLI.

## Project's Purpose

We at DevIsle, felt that the community has been longing for a good, functional and intuitive CLI rather than always writing on the command line.

**Note**: We do not discourage or refrain the community from using the as is command line instructions. In fact, we highly recommend our users to read and understand the docs so you will know what to expect. This CLI is merely an alternative!

## Credits

This CLI uses some of the best GitHub repos' commands to execute it's functionality. We would like to credit the following GitHub repos making this CLI possible

- [Facebook - Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Facebook - Prop Types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)
- [Redux - Redux & React-Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs)
- [SASS - Node-Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- [ReactTraining - React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Node-CMD](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-cmd)
- [Inquirer JS](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/)

**Be sure to check the above repos out if you're facing any issues! We are of course, always open to improvements.**

## What does this do?

It is still under development. But, as of this current beta version, we have enabled a few options like

- Installing React using create-react-app, with optional packages React Router and Redux as a single bundle.
- Installing Individual packages such as Node-Sass, React-Router, Prop Types, and Redux.
- Installing Redux automatically generates a store folder containing boiler-plate Redux code with instructions to get you started!

# FAQs

1.  How can I test this out?

- We haven't published it as a npm package yet, but we hope to do so once all of our [ Development Checklist](https://github.com/devisle/advanced-react-cli/blob/master/docs/Checklist.md) has been fulfilled.

- But you can meanwhile fork the package, and clone it to your local desktop. Once you've done that, open the terminal in that local folder and run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- After that, you may open the folder in your editor of choice. Once again, in the terminal you may simply run `npm run react-cli`to get it working. And voila!
