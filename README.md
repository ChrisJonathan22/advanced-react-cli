# Advanced React CLI (under development)

This is an npm package which aims to provide a better way to install a React starter application and third-party packages for your application through an intuitive CLI.

## Project's Purpose

We at DevIsle, felt that the community has been longing for a good, functional and intuitive CLI rather than always writing on the terminal command line.

**Note**: We do not discourage or refrain the community from using terminal commands instructions. In fact, we highly recommend our users to read and understand the docs so that you will know what to expect. This CLI is merely an alternative!

## Credits

This CLI uses some of the best GitHub repos' terminal commands under the hood, to execute it's functionality. We would like to credit the following GitHub repos making this CLI possible:

- [Facebook - Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Facebook - Prop Types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types)
- [Redux - Redux & React-Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs)
- [SASS - Node-Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
- [ReactTraining - React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated)
- [Unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next)
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [Node-CMD](https://github.com/RIAEvangelist/node-cmd)
- [Inquirer JS](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/)

**Be sure to check the above repos out if you're facing any issues! We are of course, always open to improvements.**

## What does this do?

It is still under development. But, as of this current beta version, we have enabled a few options like:

- Installing React using `create-react-app`, with optional packages React Router and Redux as a single bundle.
- Installing Individual packages such as Node-Sass, React-Router, Prop Types, and State Management.
- Redux, Unstated, Unstated-Next and Redux-Thunk have been added in the State Management.
- Installing Redux automatically generates a store folder containing boiler-plate Redux code with instructions to get you started!
- Installing Prop Types automatically generates a file containing a sample code to get started!

# FAQs

1.  How can I test this out?

- We haven't published it as a npm package yet, but we hope to do so once all of our [Development Checklist](https://github.com/devisle/advanced-react-cli/blob/master/docs/Checklist.md) has been fulfilled.

- Ensure you have git version control, and npm (node package manager) Installed. You may check if your system has them installed by running the following commands `git --version` and `npm --version`. If you don't have it installed, please visit

  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download/install git.
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download/install Node.Js (NPM gets installed with Node.Js).

- In the meantime, you can fork the repo, and/or clone it to your local desktop. Once you've done that, open the terminal in that local folder and run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
- After that, you may open the folder in your editor of choice. Once again, in the terminal you may simply run `npm run react-cli`to get it working. And voila!
